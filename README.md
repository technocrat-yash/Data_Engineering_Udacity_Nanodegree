#Project-1 : Data Modelling using PostgreSQL

## **About the Project**
Hello Folks! The aim of this project was whole designed as a use case for a music library for a startup called 'Sparkify'.<br>
In this project, I have created a ETL pipeline using Python and designed a relational database using PostgreSQL.<br>
Sparkify wants to analyse the data they have collected on songs and users on their new music streaming app.<br>
So in order, for their analysts to query data easily a relational database has been created.
